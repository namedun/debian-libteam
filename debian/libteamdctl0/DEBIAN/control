Description: library for communication with `teamd` process
 libteamdctl is a library for communication with teamd process
 (via D-Bus, Unix socket or zeromq). It is used by the `teamdctl` utility.
 .
 Libteam provides a mechanism to team multiple NICs (ports) at OSI Layer 2
 (Data link) into a single virtual NIC. The process is called "channel
 bonding", "Ethernet bonding", "channel teaming", "link aggregation", etc.
 This is already implemented in the Linux kernel by the bonding driver but
 unlike the bonding driver, libteam (user space) has the following
 additional features:
  * load-balancing for LACP support
  * NS/NA (IPV6) link monitoring
  * port priorities and stickiness ("primary" option enhancement)
  * separate per-port link monitoring setup
 .
 Libteam requires Linux kernel 3.3 or higher.
